      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question here is Why I started this personal website or blog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a very young age I began writing my experiences in a journal, it has been on and off, so here I want to keep writing more on a regular basis, weather permitting (I live in Dublin, I always have to say that). I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing my learnings in IT, and most lately moving from Technical Support Engineer to SRE/DevOps engineer. My plan is to document technical stuff  but also personal growth notes that have been helpful to my development. It could also be like another journal where I can go back to remember things I have forgotten :-D. In any case, I hope these notes can be useful for someone else too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Elias, a Venezuelan-born software engineer who&amp;rsquo;s called Dublin (Ireland), home for the past 13 years. With over 15+ years in tech, my journey has been quite the adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve evolved from a decade as a Technical Support Engineer, working across telecommunications, cybersecurity, and financial risk assessment. This diverse background gave me a unique perspectiveâ€”from troubleshooting bare-metal Linux installations, VMs on massive number, security appliances on premises and in the cloud, and now working with containerized applications in orchestrated clusters in a full SaaS environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
