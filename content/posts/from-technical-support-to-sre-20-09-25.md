# From Support to SRE:  5 Lessons from my Tecnical Support DNA

It's been a while since I made the jump to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and I've been reflecting about this career shift lately.

After 10+ years troubleshooting critical problems in telecom, cybersecurity, and financial systems, I decided it was time for a new challenge. Moving to SRE felt like the natural next step in my career when looking for career progression.

My years in support showed me that behind every application failure, there's always a story. Each problem I solved taught me how to think step-by-step, stay calm when things go wrong, and always remember how issues affect real users.

Now as an SRE Engineer, I'm learning to dig deeper into more complex systems, developing the mindset of not only knowing the root cause of issue but how to fix it. I'm working on cloud applications that can handle real-world traffic and learning how to manage infrastructure through code as it’s already a challenge itself.

**5 Key Lessons from Technical Support**

Here's what years of troubleshooting taught me that still applies today:

**1. Ask the Right Questions First**
Before diving deep, always ask: Have I seen this before? When did this last work? What changed recently? These simple questions solve more problems than you'd expect.

**2. Do the Simple Checks First**
It's tempting to look for complex solutions, but often the answer is something basic that got overlooked.

**3. Keep Everyone in the Loop**
When things break, people get anxious. Regular updates—even if there's no progress—help everyone stay calm and focused.

**4.Staying Calm When Everything's on Fire**

We all know we should stay calm under pressure, but it's harder when management and customers wants answers right now. I learned that panic makes you miss obvious solutions. Take a breath and work through problems step-by-step.

**5. Write Everything Down**
Good documentation doesn't just help others—it can save you precious time when you need to remember how you solved something months ago.

I keep reminding these lessons to this day. I still sometimes catch myself getting into panic mode when a critical issue arises, but I know now how to pull myself back.

The transition from support to SRE has been challenging but rewarding. I'm excited to keep learning and growing in this new role and in modern cloud engineering in general, while still applying the valuable lessons from my support background.

Until next time.
