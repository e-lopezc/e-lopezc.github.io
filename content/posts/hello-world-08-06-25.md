The question here is Why I started this personal website or blog?

Since a very young age I began writing my experiences in a journal, it has been on and off, so here I want to keep writing more on a regular basis, weather permitting (I live in Dublin, I always have to say that). I'll be sharing my learnings in IT, and most lately moving from Technical Support Engineer to SRE/DevOps engineer. My plan is to document technical stuff  but also personal growth notes that have been helpful to my development. It could also be like another journal where I can go back to remember things I have forgotten :-D. In any case, I hope these notes can be useful for someone else too.
