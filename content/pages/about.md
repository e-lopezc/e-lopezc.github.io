Hi there! I'm Elias, a Venezuelan-born software engineer who's called Dublin (Ireland), home for the past 13 years. With over 15+ years in tech, my journey has been quite the adventure!

I've evolved from a decade as a Technical Support Engineer, working across telecommunications, cybersecurity, and financial risk assessment. This diverse background gave me a unique perspectiveâ€”from troubleshooting bare-metal Linux installations, VMs on massive number, security appliances on premises and in the cloud, and now working with containerized applications in orchestrated clusters in a full SaaS environment.

My path to DevOps/SRE began with a simple need: automating support tasks with Python scripts. That spark ignited a passion that led me into cloud services, infrastructure as code, and transforming manual procedures into automated workflows. I like stepping outside my comfort zone to learn something new and challenging.

## What Makes Me Tick

I live by integrity and accountability when I take on a task, I'm committed until it's done right. My support background taught me to never give up, breaking complex problems into small pieces to understand the "why".

The most valuable lesson I've learned? It's not about the tools â€“ it's about the people, and how they use technology working together toward a common goal, customer satisfaction. This is what creates fantastic tech.

## Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not pushing code or debugging systems, you might catch me:

- Spinning salsa moves on the dance floor.
- Pumping Iron at the gym or at least trying. ðŸ˜‚
- Planning next family trip at home or abroad.
- Reading about personal development.
- Watching Formula 1 races.
- I enjoy watching action and sci-fi films.
- Taking leisurely walks with my wife and our four-legged friend.
- Keeping in touch with my family in Venezuela.
